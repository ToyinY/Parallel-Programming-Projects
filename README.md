2. CUDA C/C++ projects
  - vectorAdd: A simple additon of two vectors impemented in CUDA c++
  - imageBlur: A gaussian blur of an image using the weighted average of surrounding pixel values.
  - edgeDetector: An imaged edge detector using the Canny Edge Detector algorithm.
  - introCUDA: A repository with solutions to problems from Udacity Course cs344: Introduction to Parallel Programming. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/ToyinY/IntroCUDA).
